## Richard Ganney

I am an ambitious software developer finishing up at Makers Academy. After graduating from Bristol University three years ago, I moved to Australia independently where I saved enough to fund a brilliant travelling experience through North, Central and South America. Following a year away I returned to the UK to work for a recruitment consultancy in the city.

I am passionate about product design and regularly attend React and Code quality meetups. I would relish the opportunity to work for a company where I can play an integral part in the development of a particular product, be given a multitude of responsibilities, and continue to strengthen my programming skills.

## Projects

[Meet in the Middle](https://github.com/richieganney/meet-in-the-middle-react-front-end)

## Skills

#### Agile Development

Throughout makers we have been improving and consolidating our development process through personal and group projects. We held daily stand-ups, retrospectives and two-day sprints which enabled us to run our projects in a flexible and efficient way. We have also done 'process reviews' where we receive feedback from external developers on our development process after completing a task in a given timeframe. A snippet of feedback from my review:

Agile Development Process: "You took time to understand how the program was meant to run by asking the client clear questions, using examples to help edify your understanding. You asked clarifying questions during the exercise and ensured that the program still conformed to the user requirements."

#### Organisation

During my recruitment career my candidate and client data management was airtight. I was given responsibility to manage this across the whole change & transformation team by running weekly meetings, one-to-ones and helping other consultants with their data management. The ability to keep candidate and client information organised and up to date is imperative to any recruitment career and was a significant factor in helping me keep my billings consistent.

#### Go Getter

When I was 16 I made the decision early on that I wanted to move to Australia after University. After I graduated years later I took the plunge and bought a one-way ticket to the East Coast and quickly found my feet with a job and a place to rent, saving for another travelling trip to the Americas. I love to take risks and try new things, as well as experiencing different cultures.
