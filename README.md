## Richard Ganney

I am an ambitious trainee junior developer. After graduating from Bristol University three years ago, I moved to Australia independently where I saved enough to fund a brilliant travelling experience through North, Central and South America. Following a year away I returned to the UK to work for a recruitment consultancy in the city.

I would now relish the opportunity to work for a boutique firm where I can really show my talents and be given a multitude of responsibilities, whilst continuing to strengthen my programming skills.
